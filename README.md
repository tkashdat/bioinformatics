# Computational Molecular Biology
Bioinformatic projects

These are projects created during the course of Fall 2021 at ASU BIO355 with Professor Quiyun Zhu: Intro to Computational Molecular Biology

Topics studied in chronological order:
1. Storing and working with sequences in python/jupyter notebooks 
2. Working with data in NCBI, data managment to google cloud
3. Needlman-Wunch Algorithms for pairwise matching and sequencing
